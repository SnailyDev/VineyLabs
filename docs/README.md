# Viney's Universe

### WARNING - THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED

This was a RPG that you needed to explore, battle mobs on the way,
and become the most popular player in Viney's Universe.

As this project is deprecated and BARELY started, it needs to be abandoned because I will develop Java games with FXGL, for example, or libGDX, if I fix a error that I have.

## How to play/use

As the game is discontinued, there are no releases, but you can use `make build` and then `make` to run the game.

## License

The game is licensed under a non-commercial use license, called the CC-NC-4.0.
See more at [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)

## See a issue/bug?

As the project is discontinued, I won't fix bugs anyways, but, you can fork the project, make a pull request, and continue the project.

## Credits

You may need them to fork the repo:
